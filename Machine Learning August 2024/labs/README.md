### Prerequisites

- Visit our "Prerequisites" folder to review the materials, before attempting our ML course

### Technology stack
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, PyTorch - for machine and deep learning
- MLFlow - for experimenting
- FastAPI - for exposing the models
- Anything for frontend, e.g., Vue, ReAct, Angular, Jinja, Hugo, etc.
- Anything for backend, e.g., Django, Flask
- Docker for containerization, and Traefik for reverse proxy

### Outline
